Zero-K works with box64 on Ubuntu arm64 parallels though without visual effects, Beyond All Reason does not work with box64, it requires cloud gaming. (Are these games worth playing if they are so hard to get installed, are there better alternatives?)

Warzone 2100k works great (Native Mac Port)
OpenRA works great (Native Mac Port)
```

```
Hardware always trumps optimized Linux OS on x86_64 like catchyOS and Garuda Linux
```

I prefer playing Halo wars DE and Halo wars 2 on Xbox
and Age of Empires IV works on Xbox

(All these RTS games are on gamepass)

Red Alert 3 Works Great on Parallels. (Maybe even works on Crossover)

Tempest Rising works fantastic on macOS.

```

So really the only games that most people will struggle playing on macOS are those games that use spring.exe (Are those games worth playing, the engine seems highly outdated?)

```
Games with anticheat I just recommend playing on console if possible, RTS games usually don't have these restrictions, so I recommend mac for RTS + Xbox for Others
